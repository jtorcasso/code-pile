$ git pull ssh://jake@128.135.133.60/home/jake/Documents/repos/erc/data/HSIS

Yup, port 22 is blocked. You'll need to open it temporarily.

First, make sure openssh-server is installed. If the command:
sudo dpkg --get-selections openssh-server

returns nothing; that is, you get your prompt back and don't see:
openssh-server                                  install

then you need to install openssh-server with:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Check to make sure sshd is listening:
sudo lsof -i TCP:22

Check to see if your firewall is running:
sudo ufw status

If it returns inactive (the default), no firewall is running; you should be able to connect from athensx. Try the git pull command and see what happens.

If your firewall status is active, then run:
sudo ufw allow 22

to open port 22. However, it looks like you've got two samba ports open already, so it's possible your firewall is not enabled.

If you want to enable the firewall, run:
sudo ufw enable

To open those two samba ports:
sudo ufw allow 139
sudo ufw allow 445

Though personally I would recommend enabling the firewall and only opening port 22 and using more secure methods than samba for sharing your files.

In any event, install openssh-server, open port 22, and let us know what happens to your git pull.
