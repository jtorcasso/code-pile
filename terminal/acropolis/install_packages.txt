Hello Jake,

I just wanted to follow up on a few things we were talking about
yesterday. There are two different versions of python available on
Acropolis. The default "python" which is 2.6.6 and "python2.7" which is
version 2.7.3.

You are welcome to install python modules locally in your home
directory. There is a utility called easy_install-2.7 which will help
with the installation.

First you will need to pick a place in your home directory to install
your modules. For example create a directory called python in your home
directory.

mkdir ~/python

You will then add this directory to your PYTHONPATH and PATH global
variables. Add the following two lines to a file called .profile in your
home directory.

export PYTHONPATH=/home/jtorcasso/python:$PYTHONPATH
export PATH=/home/jtorcasso/python:$PATH

Log out of acropolis and back in for the changes to take affect. You can
check the variables to be sure they are set properly.

echo $PATH
echo $PYTHONPATH

Now use easy install for python 2.7 to install a module.

easy_install-2.7 --install-dir=/home/jtorcass/python PackageName

Once the installation has finished you will be able to call numpy in
python2.7.


Please try these steps and it should install.

easy_install-2.7 --install-dir=/home/jtorcasso/python2.7 cython
easy_install-2.7 --install-dir=/home/jtorcasso/python2.7 pandas
easy_install-2.7 --install-dir=/home/jtorcasso/python2.7 patsy

wget https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/archive/v0.5.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf v0.5.0
cd statsmodels-0.5.0/

python2.7 setup.py install --prefix=/home/jtorcasso/python2.7

Add /home/jtorcasso/python2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages to your python path
