You can change the resolution of the vnc desktop. It requires a restart
so first save your work. Then log into Acropolis and run "vncserver
-kill". Then run "vncserver -geometry 1920x1080". You can change 1024x768
to match the resolution of the screen you are working on. Then reconnect
to vnc as normal.
